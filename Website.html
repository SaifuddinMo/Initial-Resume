          I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering student. I attend the Carleton University. I live in Ottawa,ON,<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html">Canada</a>.
          As a keen admirer of science I was very much interested in the field of engineering from a very young age. Science had always been my favourite subject at school. I was quite interested in knowing about how everything in the world was
          connected. It was really intriguing as well as fascinating to know that the cars, computers, televisions, etc. that we use today are the emasculating masterpieces presented by engineering.

          I came up with the idea of developing devices that worked on hydraulic pressure. I made use of syringes filled with water as a source of energy. Just to sum it up it worked on the famous Pascal's Law. It wasn’t quite surprising that I would
          have bagged the first prize because I did. My devices which included the hydraulic brake, hydraulic tree shifter and the hydraulic lift were really captivating for the judges. I was able to achieve the First prize in the entire of Saudi
          Arabia.

          Another feather was added to my cap of achievements when I got the chance to attend a week’s training session at the United States Space and Rocket Centre, Huntsville, Alabama. It was a scholarship program offered by Honeywell Hometown
          Solutions.

          I am a very energetic person. Besides science, I love playing soccer. I have been a regular member of the Inter-school soccer Team. I was chosen as the captain for the school soccer team for the 2016/17 season.
